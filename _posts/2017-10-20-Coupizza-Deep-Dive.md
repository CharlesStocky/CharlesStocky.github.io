I've made this post to explain in detail how I went about coding the API for Coupizza.com. The code is in a constant state of change, but it's currently at a point where I feel somewhat comfortable with it being in production, and believe it to be somewhat sustainable in its current state. I started the process of creating Coupizza with a source of data insertion, so it seems like a natural place to start this post.
