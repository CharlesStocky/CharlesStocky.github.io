I've made this site to host my resume as well as document the process of building my first website (coupizza.com) and perhaps future projects I contribute to.

Coupizza is a pizza coupon finder that's filterable by zip code. Most larger coupon-finders pile all coupons from a merchant in one place, which makes finding location-based coupons a pain. Pizza is awesome, learning development is awesome, so I decided to jump on what I saw as a niche that wasn't being filled while teaching myself programming.

I decided coupizza would be rendered server-side, as the benefits are real. After around a month of trying to figure out how to make SSR work, I realized I was at the bleeding edge of a technology. While this excited me, and still does, I understood that I was in over my head. It fulfilled my inclination towards doing things that are challenging, but it was seriously delaying the development of the website. I decided to go back to what I was more familiar with: client-side rendering with React(RRouter V4) and Nodejs.

That was around a month ago, and since then development has advanced at much better pace. After finishing the scaffolding of the website, I began to fleshout the DB API. This was the most enjoyable part of the build up to this point. Without a lack of knowledge of a library to hinder me, I was "thinking like a developer" more often and for longer streches of time. That's not to say that I don't enjoy learning, because I enjoy it a lot, but as a beginner looking at the monolith that is learning development, it can feel as if the moments of creativity will be few and far between.

At this point I'm populating my DB (Account handles), and finishing the CSS. Once this is done I plan on deploying coupizza.
