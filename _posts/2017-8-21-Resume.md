<h1>SKILLS</h1>

<b>Programming</b> – Experienced with Javascript and object-oriented patterns, Node.js and
asynchronous concepts, as well as React’s declaractive programming paradigm.
Experienced in Python and in building user interfaces using HTML/CSS/CGI.
Experienced with SQL and noSQL databases.

<b>Platforms</b> – Very familiar with Windows, MacOS, and Linux (Kali,
Ubuntu, and Debian).

<b>Communication</b> – Able to write and speak clearly, skilled at using clear and concise
language to convey pertinent information to others.

<h1>EDUCATION</h1>
<b>CodeAcademy</b> - Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript. <br/>

<b>W3Schools</b> - HTML/CSS, Javascript, Nodejs. Used tutorials as referential material to further
my understanding of concepts that I later applied to projects using JS/NodeJS/MongoDB/Mysql.

<b>Practical Javascript</b> - Tools. Effectively learned how to use and interpret dev-
tools (Chrome, Firefox, Dragonfly) as well as code pre-planning and refactoring
through building a Todo-list web application.

<b>Eloquent Javascript</b> - Used to gain more in-depth knowledge of Javascript and
general code-related theory.

<b>Freecodecamp algorithm challenges</b> - Used to practice creation of algorithms for
anything from string manipulation to ordering numbers in a specific manner. 
The solutions to some of the challenges are on my <a href='https://github.com/CharlesStocky/Free-Code-Camp-algorithm-solutions'>Github</a> account.

<b>Learnyounode</b> - Used to gain understanding of NodeJS. Including handling HTTP’s request-response protocol within Node, managing I/O, the practice of making JS apps modular, as
well as furthering my understanding of developing within an asynchronous environment.

<b>ExpressWorks</b> - Used to learn routing in NodeJS via Express, how to implement template
engines (pug), and the parsing of JSON data.

<b>Reacttraining.com</b> – Used to gain foundational knowledge of React, React-Router, as
well as Webpack through the building of a “Github Battle” website which compares two
Github accounts and returns the ‘winner’ determined by an algorithm.
Most of my knowledge of React has been as a result of researching when encountering
scenarios I’m not familiar with. Irc channels have been one of the best resources,
Stackoverflow has also been great.

<h1>TOOLS</h1>
Text editors - Sublime, Atom, VIM(editor of choice.)

Git - Version control

Chrome dev-tools/React-dev-tools - Front-end debugging

Postman - API debugging

Docker - Isolated environment/dependencies management

Webpack - Code bundling

<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>

<b>Javascript Projects</b>
Aug 2016 – present

Hangman <br> 
- Further solidified my understanding of Javascript and string handling techniques. 

Tic-Tac-Toe <br>
- Deepened my understanding of the DOM techniques I
learned from building Hangman and introduced me to event handlers using pure
Javascript.

Coupizza <br>
- I'm close to deploying my first website. Beyond learning how to implement Node/React in a "real-world setting", this project has solidified algorithmic concepts learned from earlier projects as well as intoduced me to DigitalOcean's Droplets as a means of hosting. The website's API can be found <a href='https://github.com/CharlesStocky/coupizza.git'>here</a>. I plan on writing a more in-depth blog post surrounding the DB API once the website is deployed.
