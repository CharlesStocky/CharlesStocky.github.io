<h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>

<b>Javascript Projects</b>
Aug 2016 – present

Github open-source <a href='https://github.com/charlesstocky'>contributions</a> <br>
- Learned large codebases on the fly. Debugged/fixed errors, added features to established web applications.          

<a href='https://coupizza.com'>Coupizza.com</a> – A pizza coupon finder that’s filterable by zip code (currently down) <br>
- Using AGILE build methodology, developed CRUD operations for the DB API,
as well as RESTful operations for the website’s API. Deepened
understanding of MERN stack, as well as shell operations performed in a
virtual environment. The website’s API can be found <a href='https://github.com/CharlesStocky/coupizza.git'>here</a>. I'm constantly working on expanding the capabilities of the website.

<h1>SKILLS</h1>

<b>Programming</b> – Experienced with Javascript and object-oriented patterns, Node.js and
asynchronous concepts, as well as React’s declaractive programming paradigm.
Experienced in Python and in building user interfaces using HTML/CSS/CGI.
Experienced with SQL and noSQL databases.

<b>Platforms</b> – Very familiar with Windows, MacOS, and Linux (Kali,
Ubuntu, and Debian).

<b>Communication</b> – Able to write and speak clearly, skilled at using clear and concise
language to convey pertinent information to others.

<h1>EDUCATION</h1>
<b>CodeAcademy</b> - Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript. <br/>

<b>W3Schools</b> - HTML/CSS, Javascript, Nodejs. Used tutorials as referential material to further
my understanding of concepts that I later applied to projects using JS/NodeJS/MongoDB/Mysql.

<b>Practical Javascript</b> - Practical Javascript - Tools. Effectively learned how to use and interpret dev - tools (Chrome, Firefox, Dragonfly) as well as code pre-planning and refactoring. Used vanilla JS to build a TodoList application.  

<b>Eloquent Javascript</b> - Used to gain more in-depth knowledge of Javascript and
general code-related theory.

<b>Freecodecamp algorithm challenges</b> - Used to practice creation of algorithms for
anything from string manipulation to ordering numbers in a specific manner. 
The solutions to some of the challenges are on my <a href='https://github.com/CharlesStocky/Free-Code-Camp-algorithm-solutions'>Github</a> account.

<b>Learnyounode</b> - Used to gain understanding of NodeJS. Including handling HTTP’s request-response protocol within Node, managing I/O, the practice of making JS apps modular, as
well as furthering my understanding of developing within an asynchronous environment.

<b>ExpressWorks</b> - Used to learn routing in NodeJS via Express, how to implement template
engines (pug), and the parsing of JSON data.

<b>Reacttraining.com</b> – Used to gain foundational knowledge of React, React-Router, as
well as Webpack through the building of a “Github Battle” website which compares two
Github accounts and returns the ‘winner’ determined by an algorithm.
Most of my knowledge of React has been as a result of researching when encountering
scenarios I’m not familiar with. Irc channels have been one of the best resources,
Stackoverflow has also been great.
