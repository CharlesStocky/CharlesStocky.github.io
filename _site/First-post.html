	<p>I’ve made this site to host my resume as well as document the process of building my first website (coupizza.com) and perhaps future projects I contribute to.</p>

<p>Coupizza is a pizza coupon finder that’s filterable by zip code. Most larger coupon-finders pile all coupons from a merchant in one place, which makes finding location-based coupons a pain. Pizza is awesome, learning development is awesome, so I decided to jump on what I saw as a niche that wasn’t being filled while teaching myself programming.</p>

<p>I decided coupizza would be rendered server-side, as the benefits are real. After around a month of trying to figure out how to make SSR work, I realized I was at the bleeding edge of a technology. While this excited me, and still does, I understood that I was in over my head. It fulfilled my inclination towards doing things that are challenging, but it was seriously delaying the development of the website. I decided to go back to what I was more familiar with: client-side rendering with React(RRouter V4) and Nodejs.</p>

<p>That was around a month ago, and since then development has advanced at much better pace. After finishing the scaffolding of the website, I began to fleshout the DB API. This was the most enjoyable part of the build up to this point. Without a lack of knowledge of a library to hinder me, I was “thinking like a developer” more often and for longer streches of time. That’s not to say that I don’t enjoy learning, because I enjoy it a lot, but as a beginner looking at the monolith that is learning development, it can feel as if the moments of creativity will be few and far between.</p>

<p>At this point I’m populating my DB (Account handles), and finishing the CSS. Once this is done I plan on deploying coupizza.</p>
